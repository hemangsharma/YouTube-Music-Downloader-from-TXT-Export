The script will:

Try reading your TXT with UTF‑8, UTF‑16, then Latin‑1.

Parse out every row’s Name and Artist.

Search YouTube (ytsearch1) for each “Name Artist” query.

Download the best audio and convert it to 192 kbps MP3.

You’ll see a progress list like:

python-repl
Copy

↓ Downloading: Song Title Artist Name
...

📄 Input Format
Your .txt must be tab-delimited and include at least these columns in the header row:

nginx
Copy
Edit
Name    Artist
Additional columns are ignored.

⚠️ Troubleshooting
UnicodeDecodeError
If you still see encoding errors, ensure your export really is plain TXT (not XLS/X) and in one of the supported encodings (UTF‑8/16, Latin‑1).

ffmpeg not found
Make sure ffmpeg is installed and on your PATH. Running ffmpeg -version should print its version info.

Download failures
Sometimes YouTube search may return an unrelated result. You can rerun just that query or adjust the search terms manually.
